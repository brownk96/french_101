Welcome to French 101, the site that will give you a quick introduction to the 
French language, as well as culture and travel advice! 

For those new to this site, or to the French language in general, the best pages 
to start on would be the **Alphabet** page and the **Number** pages. These pages 
help with the basics sounds of the French language, and basic and more complex numbers.  

For those who already 
know some of the basics of the French language, the **Conversations**, **Common Words** 
or **Introductory Phrases** pages would be a great place to begin. These pages 
will cover different aspects of general conversations.

If you are looking for some travel advice, check out the **Places to Visit** or **Traveling 
Tips** pages. You may also want to look at the **Directions and Advice** or **Specific Locations** 
pages, so  that you can confidently ask for help finding where you are going next, or 
to find the nearest restroom, hotel, or airport. 

If you are looking for French culture, such as schools, differences in the way 
of life, and foods, then you should try the **Culture** page. 

Or if you are looking for other countries that you could visit that also speak French, 
try the **French Speaking Countries** page. These are countries that have French listed 
as their, or one of their, official language(s).
