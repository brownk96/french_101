French Culture 
==============

Before university, children go to *l'école maternelle* (similar to preschool) and 
then *l'école primaire* from 3 to 5 years old and 6 to 10 years old. 

Then, children to go *collége* (a false cognate that actually means middle school) 
and then *lycée* (high school) from 11 to 14 years old and 15 to 18 years old. 

In France, unlike America, the school system is *laïque* which means no form of 
religion whatsoever. In the United States, however, schools must incorporate all 
religions. 

School is also mandatory but free. 

In France, like in the United States, there are also private schools, or des établissements privés
