French Culture 
==============

Before university, children go to *l’école maternelle* (similar to preschool) and 
then *l’école primaire* from 3 to 5 years old and 6 to 10 years old. 

Then, children to go *collège* (a false cognate that actually means middle school) 
and then *lycée* (high school) from 11 to 14 years old and 15 to 18 years old. 

In France, unlike America, the school system is *laïque* which means no form of 
religion whatsoever. In the United States, however, schools must incorporate all 
religions. 

School is also mandatory but free. Hey!
